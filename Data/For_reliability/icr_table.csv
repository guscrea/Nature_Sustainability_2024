FJC IDB,Plaintiff Type,0.9401,0.9111,0.9599,nominal,"Computed from 500 random observations of FJC IDB data, comparing quasi-automated and human-inspected code applications."
FJC IDB,Defendant Type,0.9382,0.9034,0.9608,nominal,"Computed from 500 random observations of FJC IDB data, comparing quasi-automated and human-inspected code applications."
RESL,Plaintiff Type,0.8961,0.8556,0.9258,nominal,"Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Unique decision-plaintiff-type units are treated as independent observations, since a single decision can have multiple plaintiff type codes assigned to it."
RESL,Federal Government Plaintiff (binary),0.9194,0.8151,0.9664,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. The presence or absence of a federal government plaintiff is treated as a binary variable.
RESL,Firm or Trade Association Plaintiff (binary),0.9219,0.8531,0.9594,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. The presence or absence of a firm or trade association plaintiff is treated as a binary variable.
RESL,ENGO Plaintiff (binary),0.8861,0.8192,0.9295,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. The presence or absence of an ENGO plaintiff is treated as a binary variable.
RESL,Defendant Type,0.8686,0.8261,0.9014,nominal,"Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Unique decision-defendant-type units are treated as independent observations, since a single decision can have multiple defendant type codes assigned to it."
RESL,Agency,0.9889,0.9568,0.9972,nominal,"Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Unique decision-agency units are treated as independent observations, since a single decision can have multiple agency codes assigned to it."
RESL,Statute,0.8834,0.8488,0.9107,nominal,"Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Unique decision-statute units are treated as independent observations, since a single decision can have multiple statute codes assigned to it."
RESL,Climate (numeric interval),0.9962,0.9668,0.9996,interval,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed as numeric distance between number of climate keywords coded across observations.
RESL,Climate (nominal),0.6626,0.3171,0.8627,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed by treating coded number of climate keywords as nominal values that either match across coders or do not.
RESL,Climate (nominal binary),0.8307,0.2576,0.9756,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed by treating the presence or absence of climate keywords as binary nominal values.
RESL,Environmental Justice (numeric interval),0.9975,-0.1296,1,interval,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed as numeric distance between number of environmental justice keywords coded across observations.
RESL,Environmental Justice (nominal),0.5026,0.3699,0.6197,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed by treating coded number of environmental justice keywords as nominal values that either match across coders or do not.
RESL,Environmental Justice (nominal binary),0.6951,0.5079,0.8236,nominal,Computed from 200 random observations of RESL data coded three times each. Computed by treating the presence or absence of environmental justice keywords as binary nominal values.
RESL,Substantive Case Focus (Meta-Categories),0.8189,0.7304,0.8814,nominal,"Computed from 101 random observations of pre-validation RESL data coded three or four times each (n = 354, µ = 3.50, M = 4) comparing substantive focus meta-category applications."
